    //another buitl-in object in javascript is document object or DOM(document object model).
    console.log(document.body);
    /*
    document.body is a very special property so this will literally get this body HTML element
    and put it inside our JavaScript
    */
    console.log(typeof(document.body)); //object

    /*
    a really important thing to know is that when an HTML element is inside a JavaScript like this
    the HTML element is converted into a JavaScript object.the example tell us that the body HTML 
    element is just an object when it's inside JavaScript so just like any other object this has 
    properties and methods we can use 

    */
    console.log(document.title); //DOM
    //So document is a buit-in object that provided by javascript

    document.body.innerHTML='HELLO';

    /*
    This code remove everything on the page and replaces it with a text hello.
    if we save it will remove the button and just put hello.

    here is a built-in object and this is the dot notation this means we're accessing
    a property of the document object called body now body is also an object so we can
    use the dot notation again to access a property of the body object called inner HTML
    and finally we use an equal sign to change the inner HTML property to the string HELLO.

    very very important:

    but as you can see there's something very special about the inner HTML property
    when we change this property it also changes the web page so this document object
    and the web page are linked together.
    it shows us that the document object represents or models the web page and that's 
    why we call this feature the document object model or the Dom.

    so the Dom is just this built-in document object and this object works the same way
    as any other object.it contains properties like body and title that we can access using
    the dot notation now the special thing about the document object is that it is linked to
    the web page that means if we change certain properties in this object it will also change
    the web page.
    */

    /*
    so one useful property of the body element is innerHTML which we saw earlier.so the inner HTML
    property controls all the HTML inside the body. that's why it's called inner HTML so if we access
    this property it will give us all the HTML inside the body:
    */
    console.log(document.body.innerHTML);

    /*
    another feature of innerHTML is that we can replace this HTML with a new HTML code not just text
    */
    document.body.innerHTML='<button>hello</button>';

    /*method:function saved inside an object

    document.querySelector():
    let us get any element from the page and put it inside Javascript.
    */
    document.querySelector('button');
    console.log( document.querySelector('button'));

    /*
    document.queryselector lets us get any element from the page and put it inside our
    JavaScript.between these brackets we're going to put a string this string tells JavaScript
    which HTML element to get from the page so if we type button this will get the first button
    element from the page and put it inside our JavaScript
    */
    /*very very important:
     remember when an HTML element is inside JavaScript it's just a JavaScript object.
     so this button element is also just an object and it has properties and methods we
    can use. every HTML element actually has a property called inner HTML which lets us 
    control the HTML inside the element so for this button element:
    */
    console.log(document.querySelector('button').innerHTML);
    //hello

    document.querySelector('button').innerHTML='Changed';

    /*if we have more then 1 button in page?document.queryselector will only get the first button
    on the page. how do we get this second button?
    the solution is that we're going to add an attribute to this button called the class attribute

    class attribute=adds a label

    <button class="js-button">Second Button</button>

    */
     document.body.innerHTML='<button>Hello</button> <button class="js-button">Second button</button>';
     document.querySelector("button").innerHTML="javid";
     document.querySelector(".js-button").innerHTML="rezvan";

     /*

     so using a class attribute and then starting with a dot in query selector we can get any 
     specific element from the page and put it in our JavaScript.by the way when we start with
     a DOT this is called a class selector and this is also used in CSS to style elements with
    a specific class in fact anything we use in CSS can also be used in this string and also a 
    common practice is to start the class with JS Dash to make it clear that this class is being
    used in JavaScript.
     */

     /*
     so this second button is also just an object .and remember objects are values and we can save
    them inside a variable so instead of console.log let's create a variable:
     */
    const buttonElement=document.querySelector(".js-button");
    console.log(buttonElement);
    //DOM combine js and HTML together.it givs js full control of the webpage.
