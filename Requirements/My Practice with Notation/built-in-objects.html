       json and localStorage are built-in objects
       json object: helps us to work with json(json means:javascript object notation).
       json is similar to javascript object but has less features.
       */

       //javascript object

       const product3 ={
        name:'shirt',
        'delivery-time':'1 day',
        rating:{
            stars:4.5,
            count:87
        },  
        func:function function1(){
            console.log('function inside object');
        }
    };

    const product2 ={
        name:'shirt',
        'delivery-time':'1 day',
        rating:{
            stars:4.5,
            count:87
        }
    };


    /*json
     {
        "name":"shirt",
        "delivry-time":"1 day",
        "rating":{
            "stars":4.5,
            "count":87
        }
     }
     So one differnce is that all properties and strings use double quotes in Json.
     json does not support single quotes.another differnce is that json does not support function.

     Why would we use json syntax instead of javascript object syntax?
     A javascript object only makes sence in javascript.
     On the other hand json syntax can be understood by almost every programming language.
     so json syntax is more Universal.
     we use json when we send data between computers and when we store data.

     /*
     we have built-in json object that converts javascript object to json.
     stringfy is a method of the json object.so it is a function that is saved inside this object
     and we can call this function using brackets.
     between the brackets we can give it a javascript object,we want to convert like product2 
    
     */

     console.log(JSON.stringify(product2));
     //  {"name":"shirt","delivery-time":"1 day","rating":{"stars":4.5,"count":87}}

     /*
      One thing to note about stringify is that it actually results in a string
     */
     console.log(typeof(JSON.stringify(product2)));

     //Now this json string is ready to be send another computer or to be saved in storage.
