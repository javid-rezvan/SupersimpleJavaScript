        objects are refrences:
        when we create this object the actual value is created somewhere in the computer's memory 
        and this variable actually just gets a reference that points to that location in the computer's
        memory this is like a shortcut on your computer a shortcut points to where the actual file or folder
        is so there's no way to actually see this reference but just know that this is a reference and the 
        object is somewhere else in the computer's memory so the reason it works this way is to make the 
        language more efficient

       that points to the object so this makes a language more efficient because if we had a really big
       object here it's not good to copy the entire object over and over again instead JavaScript just 
       copies the reference which is much faster this is called copy by reference.

       notice that we were able to change the message property even though we created
       object 1 with const and that's because this variable just contains a reference that points to
       the object so const prevents us from changing the reference in the variable but it doesn't prevent 
       us from reaching into the reference and changing the object that it's pointing to

       true
       false
       object1 and object2 has the same refrence.so result of comparing object1 and object2 is true.
       remember that when you're comparing two variables that contain objects you're actually comparing 
       the references not the values inside.

       it will tell us that these two objects(object1 and object3) are not equal to each other even though
       they have these same values inside(message:'good job') and that's because remember objects are references
       so object 3 also contains a reference and this code compares the references and not the values inside the object
       so because object3 is a different reference than object1 that's why this code results in false.
